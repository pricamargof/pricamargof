# Welcome, everyone! üëã

My name is Priscila Figueira, and I‚Äôm a Data Analyst passionate about transforming data into insights that create real impact.  
With a background in **Engineering** and professional experience in **logistics, quality assurance, and customer service**, I decided to transition into the field of **Data Analytics** to combine my structured mindset with data-driven problem-solving.  

In 2025, I successfully completed a **Data Analytics Bootcamp at TripleTen**, where I worked on real-world projects involving **SQL, Python, Power BI, Jupyter Notebooks, and Tableau**. I developed skills in **data cleaning, statistical analysis, data visualization, and hypothesis testing**. These projects allowed me to strengthen both my technical and analytical abilities while solving practical business challenges.  

My engineering background has equipped me with a **detail-oriented and process-driven approach**, which I now apply to areas such as **business intelligence, process optimization, and decision support**. I believe in the power of data to improve efficiency, support strategy, and drive innovation across industries.  

I have hands-on experience with:  
- **Programming & Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn), SQL  
- **Visualization Tools:** Tableau, Power BI, Jupyter Notebooks  
- **Business & Process Skills:** Process optimization, reporting, customer experience, quality KPIs  

I‚Äôm excited to keep applying my skills in **projects that connect analytics to real-world impact**, and to collaborate with teams that value curiosity, clarity, and data-driven decision making.
