# Welcome, everyone! üëã

My name is Priscila Figueira, and I‚Äôm a Data Analyst passionate about transforming data into insights that create real impact.  
With a background in **Engineering** and professional experience in **logistics, quality assurance, and customer service**, I decided to transition into the field of **Data Analytics** to combine my structured mindset with data-driven problem-solving.  

My skills acquired through hands-on projects, with  **Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau**. Proven experience in data cleaning, statistical analysis, and hypothesis testing to solve business challenges and deliver strategic insights.

I have experience with:  
- **Programming & Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn), SQL  
- **Visualization Tools:** Tableau, Power BI, Jupyter Notebooks  
- **Business & Process Skills:** Process optimization, reporting, customer experience, quality KPIs  

I‚Äôm excited to keep applying my skills in **projects that connect analytics to real-world impact**, and to collaborate with teams that value curiosity, clarity, and data-driven decision making.
